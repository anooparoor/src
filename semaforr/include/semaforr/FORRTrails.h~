/*******************
FORRTrails.h

Implements the FORRTrails class, which provides SemaFORR with a Trails advisor.  This advisor aims to
utilize the saved, corrected paths from previous task points to guide the robot to reach a target
point that is near where the old path lead.  The advisor votes for moves that would bring the robot along the path
